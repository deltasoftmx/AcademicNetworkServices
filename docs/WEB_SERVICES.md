## General information

### Response data structure

```json
{
  "code": 0,
  "data": { },
  "messages": [ ]
}
```

* `code`: The exit code of the process. Helpfully to see what exactly happened.
* `data`: The data requested, or the data returned when the execution was correct.
* `messages`: A message array to help the programmer to identify easier what happened with the process.

### Mandatory headers
* **Content-Type**: application/json
* **x-api-key**: [Hash provided by server maintainer]
* **Authorization**: [JWT generated by a call to the signin endpoint of Social Network API]

Authorization header is not always required but it is at most of endpoints. Where it is required will be
mentioned on headers section of the endpoint description. This header is used to authenticate the user
that requests an endpoint.

### Codes

Following codes are common in all endpoints of the **Social Network API** and the **Administration API**.

#### General codes

The kind of codes are negative numbers. They represents errors with the data provided by the client. They DO NOT
represent an invalid comvination of data, but a invalid data type, a missing argument, an unauthorized use of the API
or in a spetial case, an unknown error.

* 0: Success.
* -1: Params are not corrects.
* -2: User token expired.
* -3: User authentication (token) not valid.
* -4: Application not allowed to use the service.
* -5: An unknown error. Check log/crash_reports.log and API log files to see what happened.

#### Fatal error codes

These are server-side errors and must be addressed as soon as possible. If they happen, application keep
working but some important features are not going to work.

* 1000: RSA keys were not found when trying to sign o verify a token.
  * What to do: You need to put the RSA key pair in their right place. Read the [documentation of how to setup the environment](ENV_SETUP.md)
  and read the RSA certs section.
